# MATH6010_Graph-and-Network
* This is homework for the course MATH6010: Graph and Network (2021-2022 Spring, SJTU).

## Contents
### Lab 1 : Minimun Dominating Set
  Randomly generate graphs that satisfy class theorem conditions and design a greedy algorithm to solve the minimum dominating set problem.

#### Usage
```
❯ g++ Graph_generator.cpp -o Graph_generator.exe
❯ g++ Minimun_Dominating_Set.cpp -o Minimun_Dominating_Set.exe
❯ g++ Test.cpp -o Test.exe
❯ .\Test.exe
```

### Lab 2 : Edge Coloring
  Use conditional probability method to achieve edge dyeing so that the number of K4 in the same color is less than or equal to the expected value.  

#### Usage
```
❯ g++ Edge_Coloring.cpp -o Edge_Coloring
❯ ./Edge_Coloring
```


### Lab 3
#### Uniform graph partition

```
❯ ./test.sh
```

#### Knapsack


#### Steiner Triple Systems

```
❯ g++ SteinerTripleSystems.cpp -o SteinerTripleSystems
❯ ./Edge_Coloring [node_num]
```
